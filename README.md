How do I use it?

After installing [Brunch][Brunch], run the following command to create a new
project in a directory named *example*:

    brunch new example -s git://github.com/Kroogs/playpen.git

*NOTE: You can replace the word example with whichever directory name you'd
like to use for your project.*

After the project has finished being created, you can initialize
it like so:

Having a static server hosting your public directory is sometimes useful for
development. You can do this by running the following command:

    brunch watch --server

This will run a local server on port 3333. Once it's running, you can visit
your application at [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333).
